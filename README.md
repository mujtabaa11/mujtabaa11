## About Me 👋

Hi, I’m **Mohamed Mujtaba**, a **Solutions Architect** and **Software Engineer** with a passion for building scalable, efficient, and impactful solutions. I specialize in designing and implementing robust systems using **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **AWS**. With a strong foundation in both technical and non-technical project management, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering results that make a difference.

- 🌱 **Learning** more about **cloud architecture** and **microservices** to design scalable and resilient systems. I am also starting to learn more about ML and AI. In fact seeing how AI is changing the world is what brought me back to coding and technology, and I am excited about the future!
- 💼 **Previously**, I worked as a **Program Officer** at **Mercy Corps** and a **Senior Program Management Associate** at **Chemonics International**, where I led humanitarian programs making real impact on some parts of the world.
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**: Java (Spring Boot, Spring Data), Python (Flask, Django, Pandas, NumPy), JavaScript (React, Next.js, Express), SQL, AWS, Docker, and more.
- 📜 **Certifications**: AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (Feb 2025) | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (Aug 2024).
